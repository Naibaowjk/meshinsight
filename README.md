# MeshInsight

# Overview
MeshInsight is a tool to systematically characterize the overhead of service meshes and to help developers quantify overhead in deployment scenarios of interest. Read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00592) for how MeshInsight works!

Note: MeshInsight currently only works on Istio. We plan to extend it to other service meshes (e.g., Cilium or Linkerd) in the future.

# Installation
## Requirements
- Python (Version >= 3.7)
- Kubernetes (Idealy version >=1.24)
  - Run `. ./utils/k8s_setup.sh` to install Kubernetes. (Note - this script is only tested on Ubuntu.)

Run the following script to install necessary tools for MeshInsight:
```bash
. ./install.sh
```
For details see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

MeshInsight has an offline profiling phase and an online prediction phase. The offline phase generates performance
profiles of individual service mesh components, and the online phase predicts overhead based on these profiles, service
mesh configuration, and application workload.

## Step 1: Run offline profiler
```bash
# Run profiler for latency and cpu overhead profile.
# Once it completes, the profile will be saved to meshinsight/profiles/
sudo python3 ./meshinsight/profiler/offline_profiler.py -d 30 --latency --cpu

usage: offline_profiler.py [-h] [-v] [-c] [-l] [-d DURATION] 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose
  -c, --cpu             run offline latency profiling
  -l, --latency         run offline cpu profiling
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        default duration is 15s                    
```
Note: The profiler will delete all kubernetes deployments before it starts to minimize interference.

## Step 2: Run online predictor
```bash
# Run prediction based on book info call graph
python3 ./meshinsight/predictor/online_predictor.py -c ./meshinsight/predictor/config/example1.yml -p meshinsight/profiles/profile.pkl

usage: online_predictor.py [-h] [-v] [-p PROFILE] -c CONFIG

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        path to the profile
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        path to config file
```

Please see `TRACE.md` for reference of config files.
